# Chaicology-Shop-sales-Analysis-in-SQL 


**Challenge:** Digits n Data SQL Case Study Challenge

**Project Description:**

The *Chaichology Shop SQL Analysis* is a real-world data analysis project designed to extract valuable business insights from a tea retail chain's data using SQL. Chaichology is a well-known tea brand operating across various locations in India, and the primary goal of this project was to leverage structured data and SQL queries to analyze their operations across four major aspects: shop information, menu items, sales data, and customer feedback.

This project forms part of the Digits n Data SQL Challenge and was developed to enhance practical SQL skills while solving realistic business problems using a database-driven approach.

**Objective:**

The core objectives of the project were:

1. To practice and implement real-world SQL queries on a multi-table relational database.
2. To analyze tea shop performance, sales distribution, and customer ratings across various locations.
3. To identify top-performing shops and best-selling products.
4. To extract actionable insights that could help improve sales, customer satisfaction, and operational decisions.

**Dataset Overview:**

The dataset for this project is structured into four primary tables:

1. **Tea\_Shops** – Contains details about different Chaichology branches across India.
2. **Menu\_Items** – Includes the list of available menu items such as different types of chai and snacks, along with pricing.
3. **Sales** – Logs each transaction, linking menu items, shop IDs, and timestamps.
4. **Ratings** – Records customer feedback and reviews, including rating scores and comments.

**Database Development:**

The project includes complete SQL scripts for:

* Creating the database and all four tables.
* Populating each table with sample or mock data.
* Performing CRUD operations and writing optimized SQL queries for analysis.

**Key Analytical Tasks & Queries:**

A series of targeted SQL queries were written to fulfill business and analytical requirements. Some of the major tasks included:

1. **Listing all tea shop details** – Retrieve structured information about every Chaichology outlet.
2. **Menu availability** – Find out which menu items are available at each specific shop.
3. **Order analysis** – Calculate the total number of orders placed for each menu item.
4. **Revenue tracking** – Compute total revenue generated by each shop, categorized by location.
5. **Identify best-selling item** – Determine the most popular product across all shops.
6. **Ratings aggregation** – Count the number of ratings each shop received.
7. **Shop quality insights** – List all shops with an average rating above 4.5.
8. **Sentiment analysis** – Retrieve reviews that contain the word “amazing” for shops based in Bangalore.
9. **Customer-product-shop linkage** – Find customers who purchased “Masala Chai” and the shops where they had it.
10. **Sales trend analysis** – Identify the day with the highest number of sales.

**Conclusion:**

This project significantly improved my ability to analyze structured business data using SQL. It provided hands-on experience with multi-table joins, aggregate functions, filtering techniques, and text search functions. The analysis performed through this case study helped uncover patterns in customer behavior, sales performance, and shop effectiveness.

By working through realistic challenges, I not only honed my technical SQL skills but also developed a better understanding of how data can directly support data-driven business decisions.

**Final Thoughts:**

This project was a submission for the Digits n Data SQL Challenge hosted by @Digits n Data and @Nitish Kumar. It served as a practical application of theoretical SQL knowledge and built the confidence to tackle complex data scenarios in real-world settings.

I’m thankful for this learning opportunity and excited to explore more such case studies in the future. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
